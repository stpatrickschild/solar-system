## Major Learning Goals/Code Review

<!-- Instructors: Feel free to practice creating specific feedback by referencing a line of code if you'd like. For example, you may say something like "nice custom method in `calculator.rb` line 42." This is optional. -->

| Criteria | yes/no, and optionally any details/lines of code to reference |

`SolarSystem`: the `list_planets` returns a string | ✔️
`SolarSystem`: the `find_planet_by_name` returns the correct instance of `Planet` | ✔️
Practices git with at least 3 small commits and meaningful commit messages | ✔️
Complex functionality is broken out into separate methods | ✔️
